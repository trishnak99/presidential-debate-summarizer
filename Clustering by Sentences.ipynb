      "And I'll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I'll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I'll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it's going up, like nobody's ever seen anything. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd. So you did that and they call you a super predator and I'm letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what's going on and he doesn't want to say law and order because he can't because he'll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it's over with. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what's happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say, if you left us 128 openings you can't be a good president. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. There's 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I'm totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that's done what I've done. When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. Prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they're like tinder and leaves and everything else. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. You did the 1990... And that's why, if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn't do anything. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they're very happy this. The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. Well, not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. But I'll tell you what somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. Tonight, as an example, everybody's had a test and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks- And also, while we're at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow's wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars? Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it's time maybe and then what happened? And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan  , they call it socialized medicine. I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that's good. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And that's despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. If we would've listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. You can't be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it'll probably be above that number. I've spoken to Pfizer, I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. And they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don't want to say anything about law and order. And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. Now we've found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn't come in with you. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. But I said, At some point you can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground. They shouldn't even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. Joe, you've had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn't provide them proper healthcare in the military. It's become very political because the left... Or I don't know if I call them left, I don't know what I call them. Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down- And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. I'm going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma. You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in, they're sending it back and you're sending. And if you were here, it wouldn't be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn't have proper health care. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. I'm urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that's what has to happen. Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, President Trump did a phenomenal job. Like every other private person, unless they're stupid, they go through the laws, and that's what it is. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives. We're planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it's very exciting for a lot of people. It's almost like a ghost town, and I'm not sure it can ever recover what they've done to New York. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you've called them a lot worse than that. No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election so they were stopped. And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. But what happened is we closed it down and now we're reopening and we're doing record business. And people are actually very happy about what's going on because our businesses are doing well. No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good. I've given big incentives for electric cars but what they've done in California is just crazy. He's a racist and he's xenophobic, because you didn't think I should have closed our country. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that's the way it is, unfortunately. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, I support President Trump. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China. Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts. And I think we're going to do well because people are really happy with the job we've done. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we've put back into the workforce. One of them came out last week, you saw that, Oh, we're going to open up on November 9th. Because if you say those words, you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, President Trump saved thousands of lives. I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that. You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I'm not going to do that. He said, Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn't do it. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. I'm doing my job as a president, and I'll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don't. And can you imagine where they say, You have to have your ballot in by November 10th. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who's far left, on the manifesto, we call it. Because he said it's a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1st. I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that's cheaper and better. We've had no negative effect, and we've had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said, He's xenophobic. And plenty of companies that are already here, they'll leave for other places. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. That's seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. Many of your Democrat Governors said, President Trump did a phenomenal job. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid- We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. So why didn't you get the world... China sends up real dirt into the air. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare. I'm getting it for so cheap it's like water, you want to know the truth. But for the ballots, I think so, because what's happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. Well, first of all, I guess I'm debating you, not him, but that's okay. I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance. If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don't, Obamacare is no good. But I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You call them super predators, and you've called them worse than that. They don't exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up. Why didn't you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama? African-Americans are super predators and they've never forgotten it. During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. If I run it badly, they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me. And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars. But they won't do it, because they're run by radical left Democrats. ... and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place-  . She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. There aren't a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. That's not what you've said and it's not what your party is saying. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare. Well, I've spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. On November 3rd, you're watching, and you see who won the election. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. And by the way, now it's being built again and it's going up fast. Did Burisma pay him 183,000 a month, with no experience in energy? Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. I think I'm counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. In 47 months, I've done more than you've done in 47 years, Joe. Well wait, he didn't get three and a half million dollars, Joe? They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you. We don't need somebody to come in and say, Let's shut it down. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris. We had to, because we didn't know anything about the disease. Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. That's more money than our country could make in 100 years  - You didn't want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. And I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that's- And you ought to be careful of them, they'll over throw you. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. Frankly, it was more violent than what I'm even seeing now. I was with the head of a major country, it's a forest city. They were a disgrace to our country, and we've caught them. I hope we don't need them, in terms of the election itself. They're called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. You graduated last in your class not first in your class. Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto. He didn't think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of... I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. And you would see problems like you've never seen before. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. And he didn't have a job until you became vice president. They're sending millions of ballots all over the country. Chris, he's so wrong when he makes a statement like that- He's been a professor for a long time at a great school. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people- And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace. Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow? If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. They're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. We've done things that you never even thought of doing. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very... Now, by the way, we're going to see how that turns out. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we're doing. You're talking about almost it's like being in prison. You'll see it as soon as it's finished, you'll see it. We have to go back to the core values of this country.\n"

      "We're going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people... Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. There's many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. And what I'm going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we're going to work this out. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives. The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that's you before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn't do that because it's not a national emergency. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we'd probably save up to 100,000 lives. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye? And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, Here's $20 billion. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when... And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. Number one, number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. He still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn't even tell you. Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I'm totally opposed to defunding the police offices. ... we're going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. ... second point I'd make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? Well, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don't work for him. Making sure that we can do that, we're going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be legitimate. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I've gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we're not going to take any of his stuff. You've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. He's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. The fact is, it's going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they're going to vote, when they're going to vote, and what means by which they're going to vote. But she's written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Do you believe for a moment what he's telling you in light of all the lies he's told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him... Look what's happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety. His failure to deal with the environment, they're being flooded, they're being burned out because his refusal to do anything. There's systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it's enforced. Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it. He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don't pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars. He doesn't want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, Let's get everybody together. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. Look how much we're paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with... By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it's a fraudulent process. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn't want to panic the American people. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we're for a vaccine, but I don't trust him at all. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. Now, what's at stake here is the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter, because if we get the votes, it's going to be all over. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks? The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's emitted in the United States. And under my proposal, we're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company- It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a guy who says that you don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker- And if he doesn't do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. That's on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that's also at stake right now. Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. People who've been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. And by the way his own former spokesperson said, Riots and chaos and violence help he cause. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. He's own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization- We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Why does he take care of the... You can't fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. ... testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. But we've never accomplished it, but we've never walked away from it like he has done. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. Many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings, but it makes a big difference. And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you're talking about. Here's the point, the point is that that's why he keeps trying to rile everything up. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act? The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. There's so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. And the justice, I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. I've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. If it doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal. ... we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what's happening. And If you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences. Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. I'm sure that you've already fired most of them, because they did a good job. He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies? Some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until election day. But by the way, if in fact he says, he's not sure what he's going to accept. The other thing that's on the court, and if it's struck down, what happens? If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. What it's going to do, it's going to create thousands and millions of jobs. He's been running on that, he ran on that and he's been governing on that. They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. You in the home, you got less you're in more trouble than you were before. We're not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants- When the votes are counted and they're all counted, that will be accepted. I'll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted. I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here's the deal. They've been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. Every body in your administration tells you the true, it's a bad idea. And if there's thousands of ballots, it's going to take time to do it. He won't ever look you in the eye and say that's what he wants to do. A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, No, no, no. And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. By the way, I'm going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may- And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. He doesn't want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayer's money. The final question is, I can't remember which of all his rantings  . What they're saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. We, in fact, have 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. When he was presented with that number, he said, It is what it is. He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can't stay divided. I'm talking about my son, Beau Biden, you're talking about Hunter? Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it's you. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. The deal is that it's going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. The fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie.\n"
