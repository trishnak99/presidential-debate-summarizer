Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare. We don't need somebody to come in and say, Let's shut it down. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. Why don't you say the words law enforcement? And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it. ... So don't tell me about a free transition. And I'll tell you why- I'll tell you what it means-

Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. Why didn't you do it over the last 25 years? Ohio had the best year it's ever had last year. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you've called them a lot worse than that.

We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. You're going to socialist- Your party doesn't say it. You would have been much later, Joe, much later. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare. Prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do. If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. Premiums are too high, that it doesn't work. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that's the way it is, unfortunately. Well, you didn't do very well in Swine Flu. You don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer? Well, we're going to deliver it right away. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They're going to be delivering- It's all set up. You'll have the vaccine sooner than that. I will say this- They've also said- Dr. Fauci. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. So we built the greatest economy in history. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. You're talking about almost it's like being in prison. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I'm very happy to do it- You'll see it as soon as it's finished, you'll see it. Also, they took over something that was down here. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen. So- You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. So you did that and they call you a super predator and I'm letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. That's not what they are talking about this. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say, if you left us 128 openings you can't be a good president. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places. We have now the lowest carbon... If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. Our businesses aren't put out of commission. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. I was with the head of a major country, it's a forest city. I'm getting along very well with the governor. That's burning down because of a lack of management. Well, not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. Not true- He's talking about the Green New Deal. This is a 100 trillion- You were vice president- So why didn't you get the world... China sends up real dirt into the air. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars. You're on tape- Oh, well, that's a big statement. So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. We have major states   with that- ... all run by Democrats- All run by Democrats. This is a horrible thing for our country. This is not going to end well- I love counting the votes  - Chris, he's so wrong when he makes a statement like that- Excuse me  - Could be months- I'm urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that's what has to happen. from a common sense- They're not equipped... Number two, they cheat.

I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. Well wait, he didn't get three and a half million dollars, Joe? He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.

That's not what you've said and it's not what your party is saying. But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said, He's xenophobic. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, President Trump saved thousands of lives. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. That was said sarcastically, and you know that. He said very strongly, Masks are not good.

Even if we did it after the election itself. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that's cheaper and better. Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now. They'll be careful, but they want their schools open. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. But I don't want to accept the National Guard. Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn. On November 3rd, you're watching, and you see who won the election. An election could be won or lost with that.
