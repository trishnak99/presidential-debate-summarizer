He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. Donald would you just be quiet for a minute. I'm going to get very lucky tonight as well. He has Executive Orders that have no power. No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. By the World Bank- By everyone, has discredited. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. ... Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I'm totally opposed to defunding the police offices. Nobody's going to build another coal fired plant in America. And If you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. If it doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He's just afraid of counting the votes- When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit.

We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker- He's not worried about the people out there  . He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him... He says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people... Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. They look down on people who don't have money. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes. My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. The fact is, it's going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be legitimate.

The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person. Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it.

Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President. He's been running on that, he ran on that and he's been governing on that. They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. And there was no one ... We didn't shut down the economy. The reason it's shut down is because, look, you folks at home. This is the same man who told you- This is the same man. Well, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don't work for him. You have to provide them classic- Will he just shush for a minute? Fewer jobs than when he became president. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. Because you weren't president- You're the worst president America has ever had. Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And so you take a look at what he's actually done. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And what I'm going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we're going to work this out. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. I've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted. Every body in your administration tells you the true, it's a bad idea. They're going to move to renewable energy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. That is not- Simply... Look- That is simply not the case- What it's going to do, it's going to create thousands and millions of jobs. He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies? Some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until election day. And if there's thousands of ballots, it's going to take time to do it.

That's not true he was not dishonorably discharged.

And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders. The fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie. Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators. They're the people... And by the way- By the way- He's on record as saying it. That's what he said, I'm going to be okay. People who've been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And matter of fact   Matter of fact- ... testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well. The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. This is the guy who says that, the fact that- He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may- We're not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants- His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. What they're saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. And by the way, our military... The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too.
